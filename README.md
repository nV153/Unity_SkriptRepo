Unity_ScriptRepo

This repository contains a collection of old C# scripts I used in a Unity project.
The project itself was never completed as originally planned, partly due to the intention to collaborate with others—which ultimately didn't happen. As a result, many features remain unfinished or feel out of place.
This repository is now meant to serve as a showcase of my coding style and general programming abilities, so I’ve removed all unrelated files and content that don't directly demonstrate my work with Unity scripts.

Please note:
-These scripts are intended to be used within the Unity engine and will not function correctly outside of it.
-Despite some scripts being incomplete or outdated, they still provide insight into how I structure and organize my code.
-I’ve also removed third-party or imported asset scripts (e.g. Outline shaders) to avoid confusion with objects or references not created by me.
