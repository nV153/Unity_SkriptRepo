Unity_ScriptRepo

This repository contains a collection of old C# scripts I wrote for a 3D Unity project.

The project itself was never fully completed, mainly because it was originally intended as a collaborative effort—which didn’t come together as planned. As a result, some features remain unfinished or may seem out of place.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my coding style and general programming skills. To keep things focused, I’ve removed all unrelated files and non-code assets, including third-party or imported scripts (e.g. outline shaders) that referenced unknown objects.

Please note:
- These scripts are intended to be used within the Unity engine and may not function properly outside of that context.
- While some scripts are incomplete or dated, they still offer a look into how I approach structuring and organizing code.

Noteworthy Scripts
Some of the more interesting or developed parts of the project include:
- Player Movement Scripts – Custom movement logic tailored for responsive in-game character control.
- Inventory System Scripts – Code managing item handling, storage, and user interaction within an inventory system.
